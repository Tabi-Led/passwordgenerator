i spent 30 minutes trying to figure out why my deployed web page was getting a "404" error 
-forgot that it's routing to develop folder 
-didn't realize there was supposed to be a "/" at the end. May or may not be in mild tears. 
Side note- this is my second repo. The initial repo that I started writing in, I accidentally pulled the starter code repo in....and had to start over in a new repo. This one. I feel like an idiot.
